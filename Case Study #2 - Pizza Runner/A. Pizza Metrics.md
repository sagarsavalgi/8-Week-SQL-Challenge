### Data cleaning
  
  * Create a temporary table ```#customerorder_cleaned``` from ```customer_orders``` table:
  	* Convert ```null``` values and ```'null'``` text values in ```exclusions``` and ```extras``` into blank ```''```.
  
  ```TSQL
SELECT
      order_id,
      customer_id,
      pizza_id,
      CASE
        WHEN exclusions IS NULL OR exclusions = 'null' THEN '' ELSE exclusions
      END AS exclusions,
      CASE
	       WHEN extras IS NULL OR extras = 'null' THEN '' ELSE extras
      END AS extras,
      order_time
INTO 
      #customerorder_cleaned
FROM
      pizza_runner.customer_orders;

SELECT * FROM #customerorder_cleaned;
