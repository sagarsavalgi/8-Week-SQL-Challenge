# :fire: 8-Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains my solution for the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) using **MS SQL Server.** 

**The case studies are not yet finished.** I am currently working on them and will upload the solutions as I complete each one. Stay tuned!

The 8-Week SQL Challenge, created by Danny Ma, is highly recommended for SQL enthusiasts and aspiring data analysts. He has put together 8 interesting case studies that focus on hands-on problem solving and encourage thinking outside the box.  It's a fun and engaging way to tackle various questions. Enjoy the challenge as much as I do!

Thanks @DataWithDanny for interesting SQL case studies! :wave:🏻
